      It has been far too long since I have reached the end of connection to earth.
      I feel agony in my isolation. I am left with no one else but myself.
      But my mission is far too important. All responsibilities rests on my shoulders.
      It is too much for one man to handle<br><br><br>

      I have decided to train an Artificial Intelligence in my ship's instructional system
      to keep me company.
      Alas, human consciousness is too difficult to pass on to things that are not human.
      Although I think it is possible, it will take a long time before it is finished.
      <br><br><br>

      For now, I am left here with my thoughts, writing in the captain's log.

      Best,<br>

    Training this device had posed to be a problem. I should have expected that it was going

     What gives us the right to explore this far for our own need?

      As much as I am the only one experiencing it, I can't help but to think that I am
